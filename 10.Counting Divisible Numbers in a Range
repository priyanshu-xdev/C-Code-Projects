Write a C program that takes three integers as input: two numbers, start and end, representing a range, and a third number, divisor.
The program should count how many numbers between start and end (inclusive) are divisible by the divisor.

Example:

Input: start = 1, end = 10, divisor = 3
Output: 3 (numbers 3, 6, and 9 are divisible by 3)
